This mobile application is an inventory management tool designed to help users securely track and manage their inventory items while receiving timely SMS alerts when stock levels fall below a set threshold. The app addresses key user needs by providing a secure login interface, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive inventory data, and by offering a streamlined inventory screen where users can easily add, update, or delete items. The interface was crafted with user-centered design principles in mind; clear dialogs and intuitive navigation ensure that users can effortlessly interact with the app and receive immediate feedback, such as confirmation messages and alerts, enhancing overall usability.
In developing this application, I made a modular coding approach that separates responsibilities across different components. The DatabaseHelper class is responsible for managing SQLite database operations, including creating tables and executing CRUD operations, while various fragments (like FirstFragment and SecondFragment) manage user interactions and data presentation. A standout feature of the app is its integration of SMS alerts, which proactively notify users when inventory quantities are low, thereby preventing potential stock shortages. Throughout the development process, thorough manual testing was conducted to validate functionality from secure user authentication to accurate inventory management and alert triggering demonstrating a commitment to reliability and quality. This project not only exemplifies my technical skills in mobile app development and database management but also highlights my ability to innovate and apply user-centered design principles effectively, ensuring that the final product is both functional and user-friendly.
